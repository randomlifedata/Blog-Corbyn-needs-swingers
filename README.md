Corbyn needs swingers blog
==========================
  
The code and data in this repository supports a blog article on RandomLifeData.com. The code is a markdown file (labourswing.md) that can be converted using R's KnitR package to an HTML document with all the figures and analysis completed and embedded alongside the text. 

You can open the markdown document in any text editor and see the analysis quite transparently. 

If you have any questions, please do open an issue on GitHub or contact me via the randomlifedata.com website

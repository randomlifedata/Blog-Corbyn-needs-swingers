Corbyn needs swingers blog
==========================
  
The code and data in this repository supports a blog article on RandomLifeData.com. The code is a markdown file (labourswing.md) that can be converted using R's KnitR package to an HTML document with all the figures and analysis completed and embedded alongside the text. 

You can open the markdown document in any text editor and see the analysis quite transparently. 

Alongside the code (labourswing.md) is the output from KnitR - a .txt file, an .html file (the webpage) and a folder containing the figures produed by R (figure folder). There is also a .png image that is used in the webpage to show voter turnout history - I obtained this from: <a href="http://www.ukpolitical.info/Turnout45.htm">UK Political Info</a>
